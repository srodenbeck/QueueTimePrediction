# Hypotheses
- Features derived from jobs currently running and jobs currently in queue will result in more predictive capabilities than features from the given job
- Multilayered neural network will outperform other types of models, such as decision trees (like those from Karnak) or simpler models (like linear regression)
- Jobs which request more resources (CPU, Memory, Nodes) will result in a longer queue time on average
- Jobs with a higher Timelimit (requested wallclock) will have a longer queue time on average.
